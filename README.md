Our goal is to determine if getting high yields makes a customer become more loyal to MyAgro products. Customer loyalty will be measured by customers’ re-enrollment dates, amounts of packages purchased, training attended, and payment dates in the following year. We will utilize exploratory data analysis and visualizations to analyze clients, sales, and harvest data provided by the MyAgro team to find insightful attributes and suggest them to MyAgro’s sales strategy and resource allocation.

Our Data is directly obtained from the MyAgro Team, shared by Shachia Kyaagba. These four datasets in this setting are Client, Harvest, Payment, and Package.
